🟥 REDLINE v0.1 Documentation

REDLINE is a high-performance, transpiled systems language designed to be as readable as Python but as fast as C++.

1. Variables & Constants

REDLINE distinguishes between data that changes and data that stays the same. This allows the compiler to optimize memory.
Keyword Meaning C++ Translation
val Immutable (Constant). Cannot be changed once set. const
var Mutable (Variable). Can be updated later. (Standard variable)

Syntax:
Python

val name: string = "Ace"
var health: int = 100

1. Data Types

REDLINE is strictly typed, meaning the "Brain" ensures you don't accidentally treat a number like a word.

    int: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).

    float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 10.5).

    string: Text wrapped in double quotes (e.g., "Redline").

3. Functions

Functions in REDLINE use a modern "Arrow" syntax to show what they return.

Syntax:
Python

def name(param: type) -> return_type: # Logic here
return value

    pub: (Optional) Use before def to make the function accessible globally.

    ->: Points to the type of data the function gives back.

4. Control Flow (Decision Making)

REDLINE uses if and else for logic. It uses C-style comparison operators but Python-style structure.

Comparison Operators:

    == (Equal to)

    != (Not equal to)

    > (Greater than)

    < (Less than)

    >= / <= (Greater/Less than or equal)

Example:
Python

if speed > 200:
print("Turbo Active")
else:
print("Cruising")

1. Standard Output

The built-in print command handles communication with the console. It is powered by the rl_io.hpp library in your stdlib folder.
Python

print("System Initialized")
print(42)

1. The Compiler Pipeline

Understanding how your code turns into a program helps with debugging.

    .rl File: You write your logic here.

    Rust Brain (redline-core): Reads the tokens and translates them.

    output.cpp: The intermediate C++ file generated by Rust.

    G++ Compiler: Turns the C++ into machine code (the "garbage text" binary).

    Executable: A lightning-fast file you can run directly.

7. Future Keywords (Roadmap)

These are keywords reserved for our next updates:

    while / for: For loops.

    input: For taking user keyboard data.

    import: For loading other .rl files.
